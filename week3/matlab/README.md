To run the amazing Regression Learner (or Neural Network Learner):

 - Go to Apps, down arrow (at the far right side), Regression Learner
 - Select New Session, select "T" from the Wordspace Variable
 - Hit "Start Session"
 - For "Model Type", hit the down arrow, select "All"
 - Hit "Train" (make sure that Use Parallel is selected)


Do the same but for "Neural Network Fitting" as well
